MetaBake is a LOW-CODE platform that simplifies the process for building of great software.  MetaBake allows you to reduce your overall cost of development. MetaBake allows different levels and types of developers within your organization to be able to build applications. So you don't need to have only expensive developers building your applications. The MetaBake LOW-CODE platform allows you to build six to ten times faster than traditional development.


mBake.org is the extensible LOW-CODE productivity tool for programmers, via static generation; with Pug, Markdown and more; including dynamic data binding. *Some developers implement applications faster than others.*
