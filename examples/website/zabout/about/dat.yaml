content_text: MetaBake&trade; is a low-code platform that simplifies the process for building of great software. It is easy to use, navigate, and edit. MetaBake&trade; allows you to reduce your overall cost of development. MetaBake&trade; allows different levels and types of developers within your organization to be able to build applications. So you don't need to have only expensive developers building your applications. The MetaBake&trade; low-code platform allows you to build six to ten times faster than traditional development, and this is because we're not creating code. MetaBake&trade; allows for visually modeling an application and encompassing the full application life cycle. Everything from designing, development, and deployment is all handled within the platform.
