## Why MetaBake ?

#### MetaBake 's goal is: **high development productivity**


The view for most people in leadership/management roles today is that the process of software development is far too slow. Website, web app, and native mobile app development takes too long to put into production and is too expensive. Historically, software development makes huge productivity leaps roughly every 10 years. You can see this as we moved from mainframes to data centers, data centers to cloud servers, and moving from 1st to 2nd to 3rd generation programming languages (e.g. 1GL machine, 2GL assembly, 3GL: javascript). We haven’t made a large leap forward in productivity in ~15 years and we’re overdue for the next phase.


I set out to look for the next step forward in software productivity. I
have documented the 10 core pillars that will lead software development
for the next 10-15 years. For this article's purposes, I will look at it
from a manager's point of view. For example, let's say a company has
been able to get by without a CTO, but now, they need one to take their
productivity to the next level. You, the reader, is hired to be the new CTO.
How do you lead a team of intelligent VPs, Directors, and managers of
software development to the next level?
