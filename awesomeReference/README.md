## Awesome Less code list of Metabake resources


## Less code = 10X faster web app development.
### With Metabake's modern development approach, it is not about replacing your tech stack with another tech stack -- it is about eliminating it!


## Meta overview

To get an overview of Metabake pillars:

# Additional examples and plugins:
In addition to the examples in mbake CLI:

## Features

One feature of Metabake is that it is text based, and not GUI, like Webflow for example. All the GUI tools are limited and a bit like FrontPage 2.0.
Also, you should avoid prototyping in GUI tools - text prototyping is just as fast an fully interactive.

-i # from i_dat.yaml creates items json, reading all the dat.yaml - for dynamic binding!

-f # Will take a map.yaml and create sitemap.xml, menu.json and FTS.idx. You can use FTS in browser after a fetch in loading here [lunrjs.com/guides](https://lunrjs.com/guides/index_prebuilding.html#loading)

-j # list.csv to list.json


## Documentation TOC:

These are the 3 main project, that leverage the 10 pillars:

- [mbake](http://doc.metabake.org/mbake); CLI, and foundation. Please give it stars: '*'
- [SPA](http://doc.metabake.org/SPA); eg. Brick and Mortar, examples, eg: PhoneGap v8
- [Meta](http://doc.metabake.org/meta); Vista, Bespoke starter for Admin/Build automatic Services and WebIDE

'Train-the-Trainer' is scheduled about monthly, and it is announced in the forum. Feel free to post questions there.


Prerequisites: you should know HTML and CSS. If you need to catch up, we recommend 'Design and Build Websites' by Jon Duckett. You will also learn Pug, to get started on Pug, watch [Pug on Youtube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=wzAWI9h3q18)

## Meta Definitions:
- Pug : A templating language, position as Less code Declarative 4GL. Custom 'tags' in Pug via RIOTjs (and obfuscated as well as Andorid's ProGuard)
- Cloud v2: No known end point. E.g.: CDN, AWS Cognito. AWS Lambda does have a server end point, so it is not Cloud v2
- Team Player: Benefits group via Cloud Dev Environment, ex: CodeAnywhere+Meta. Selfish: Local dev. environment.
- SCSS theme framework: Google/search for 'Front End Framework' yields Bootstrap, Bulma, Spectre, etc. We have examples with a few in Github project of same name.
- Meta: Building software that builds software. Has more than one level of meaning.


Sins to eschew:
- js, prefer Pug
- local IDE dev, use Cloud IDE


## NOTES:

- Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined
    at loadFile (loadjs.js:106)
* This happens if your CSV comma is of for your loadjs command.

### Message from creators of Metabake:

We were involved with Struts and SilverStream. We plan to make Metabake more popular than both.
