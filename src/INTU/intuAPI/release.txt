IntuAPI docs are live here:
https://intuition-dev.github.io/INTUITION

If you change 
https://github.com/intuition-dev/INTUITION/blob/master/src/INTU/intuAPI/IntuAPI.ts
then run docs.sh there to update the docs.

Also copy the the produced min.js to here:
https://github.com/intuition-dev/toolBelt/tree/master/intuAPI
so that the current version is in the toolBelt.
