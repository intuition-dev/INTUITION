#### 'INTUITION.DEV is an open source tool for pro developers w/ 10 fold productivity; via low-code application development, cross-platform static-generator, and a built-in WebAdmin editor - facilitating maintenance by end users.'

#### Please star our main project here:
- https://github.com/intuition-dev/INTUITION

INTUITION.DEV has WebAdmin Screen for any CRUD app, CMS, e-Com, Mobile, AMP, etc.  It uses [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and is written in [pug](https://pugjs.org/language/tags.html).

In WebAdmin, you can edit screen app or content using markdown or pug - which won't let you pages become broken. It also can leverage native custom elements/ standard web-components and use any framework. It allows you clone existing pages to write another post/page, upload images, custom write own layout in pug, etc. Anything app that you can write or use in HTML, .js/.ts or css/SASS can leverage INTUITION.DEV.
