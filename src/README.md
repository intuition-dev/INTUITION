# Install WebAdmin

- Install node, yarn

1. `yarn global add meta-intuition`

2. Before you run, create free emailJs ( https://www.emailjs.com ) account: so Meta Intuition accounts can be validated via email.

2. In Terminal: `metaI`

3. Setup configurations in the browser window `:9081/setup`

3. Fast URL's
   `:9081/admin` - to add users
   `:9081/editors` - to edit site

4. Optional: Use HTTP server (eg: Caddy) to proxy :9081 to get https

Notes: It was not clear to me what to do after setup. It took me to a login screen. I expected an email to tell me ... something.
