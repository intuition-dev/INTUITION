## INTUITION.DEV approach:

In a future with increasing automation, citizen-developers have become more widespread. Nowadays almost everybody can pull out a form or a web app using low-code tools.
Unlike other low-code tools, this one is aimed at professional developers and uses a standard language: Pug. We started first with a static code generator and then added a WebAdmin that lets you edit - and then kept adding features and refactoring. We hope to make open source low code approach popular with professional developers.

### Easy

So we have open source low-code with static generation.
A major piece is adding a 'WebAdmin' editor to INTUITION.DEV and your application. One a professional developer writes and sets up version one of the app - then the developer can
 enable end-user to maintain the app and possibly write the next version of the app. So as the business needs change, the web app is evergreen and always aligned to the business. 

You can write any and every kind of app, since we generate  HTML, javascript an css.  Our main language is Pug, if you have not seen Pug before, here is a quick intro to Pug:
