# DISCLAIMER: 
# You should back up your working server before using this script to deploy new version. 
# Likely backup to a mounted NAS as tar.gz. 
# In addition this may make your git password visible to other users of the computer you run gitdown command on.

# Likely you want to work/be in your http servers public dir (eg: where Caddyfile is)
# This folder will be deleted. And replaced with fresh code from the specified branch
LOCALFolder: 'adminA'
# LOCALFolder: 'dashB'

# Must be 'master' *99%* for DEV(1). 
# If branch does not exists, will create branch, mostly for regular STAGE(2). 
# Else if branch exists it will download that branch (eg. for irregular flow, if the branch had changes since creation)
# And of course, *never* create a new branch for|on PROD(3) - allow STAGE to test first and then copy/ZIP (no Git).
# So you should not use this for PROD(3, for prod you should zip STAGE and rebuild with ENV set to PROD-3)
# eg branch format: yearmonth-day a,b,c... if there are rare multiple releases that day
BRANCH: 'r1905-011xyz' 
# BRANCH: 'r1912-28a'

# After download and make/bake: change http server(eg Caddyfile) to point to the new folder.
# * Irregular flow would be that you have a bug in prod, but you don't want a new full release, just that bug fixed. So staging has the old production branch.
# And dev then is the staging new staging branch - allowing QA of both the new features and that production did not regress.
