# DANGER: 
# You should back up your box before using this script to deploy new version. Think of it as a feature: sometimes it deploys - sometimes it tests your fail over
# and recovery procedure, 
# likely from a remote NAS tar.gz. In addition this may make your password visible to other users of the computer you run this command on.
# In any case no developer of this open source is liable in any way if the scripts here create an outage, issues or problems.

# master *always* for DEV(1). 
# If branch does not exists, will create branch, mostly for regular STAGE(2). 
# Else if branch exists it will download that branch (for irregular flow, if the branch had changes since creation)
# And of course, *never* create a new branch for|on PROD(3) - allow STAGE to test first and then copy.
# So you should not use this for PROD(3, for prod you should zip STAGE and rebuild with ENV set to PROD-3)
# eg format: yearmonth-daya,b,c... if there are more releases that day
