# Starting

mbake lets you rapidly create mockups.

Just create an index.pug and dat.yaml.

As you edit files, you need to run:
```
   mbake .
```
This will build the Pug files into html. After you are comfortable with mbake, in the Meta section you will learn how you and your entire team can 'auto build' via Meta's open source cloud service.


#### Default Front End framework(FW)

The default front end framework used in most examples is Spectre CSS, but you can use any of the dozens out there. Spectre has relatively small size, AMP support and ease of use.

Check out the FW project to learn how to make CSS from SASS FW. For example, gridform is used in the login form.
