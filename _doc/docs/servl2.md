# Cloud v2 II: Use Firestore for pure client-side CRUD and authentication

Firebase is well documented on the web. Read up on Firebase/Firestore to learn how to use it.

Similar to AWS Cognito, Firebase includes pure client-side user authentication.

Firebase also has push and a database named Firestore.
It can be used from the browser via JavaScript, no custom Cloud v2.0 code is needed. This is key to be able to develop faster.

The CRUDA example app (mbake -c) uses Firebase.

FIreStore replaces MongoDB, but also ORM, REST, DevOps, Security, Failover, etc.
