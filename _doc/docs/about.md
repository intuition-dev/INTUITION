# About MetaBake

MetaBake.org is a development productivity suite. It should allow you to deliver 10 times faster then legacy development stacks/methodologies. We have found that - with MetaBake.org; - the work of 6 developers over 6 months can be done by 3 developers in 3 weeks. We expect you to achieve the same productivity gains.


#### MetaBake.org productivity is based on three modules:

- mbake, a static site generation tool that runs locally
- B-M-SPA, curated technologies and techniques that help you build dynamic apps and mobile apps faster
- Meta, a bespoke cloud-based build and admin app infrastructure that helps deliver functionality to your clients more quickly

We benchmark against _LAMP_, _RAILS_, _MEAN_ and such For example, LAMP is the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so technology gets 10 times better, which *forces* everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C/.js is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive team.

So far, somehow, server-side rendered LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WordPress having some 30% of the World Wide Web. It is time to start displacing that.

You can reinvest the time saved by using MetaBake into a more interactive user experience (UX). Better UX is proven to lead into higher user engagement and better user retention.

## About mbake


_mbake_ leverages the clarity, simplicity and productivity gained by using the declarative markup language _Pug_. We think of Pug as 4GL.

_mbake_ currently compiles Pug, Markdown and Yaml to generate HTML and JSON. Using the power of JavaScript, more transformers can be added. _mbake_ runs as a small node process, either on your machine or in the cloud.

_mbake_ generates static sites, but it also supports making those sites dynamic with API calls and data feeds such as from JSON.

_mbake_ helps is another example of a http://staticgen.com webapp.

_mbake_ includes sample starters apps for CRUD and mock-ups. After you are comfortable with mbake, check out B-M-SPA and Meta.


Prerequisites: you should know HTML and CSS. If you need to catch up, we recommend 'Design and Build Websites' by Jon Duckett. You will also learn Pug, to get started on Pug, watch [Pug on Youtube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=wzAWI9h3q18)


Best way to get started with mbake is to read the Docs, linked at he top of the page.
