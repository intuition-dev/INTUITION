# Review example Master/Detail(M/D) CRUD

### Pre-reqs

You should have reviewed Pug 1 and 2, Cloud v2.0 1 and 2, Mockups and FE FW (Front end frameworks) project. And basics like 'inspect/copy selector' and 'network/disable cache'.

Also use resources link on the left, Chat/Form/Support and check out:
- [DataTables](http://datatables.net)

## Goal of M/D

- Login and get a list.
- Click an item on a list to get edit view
- Edit and save, and see the new list.

You'll leverage FireStore and write RiotJS tags(components) in Pug.


### Exceptions

Sometimes, but it must be very rare in Metabake, you need to write your own API. When doing this, you should *not* document your endpoints/REST server side. Instead write your client-side calls, and document how to use the API.

Check out Axios and 'Documentation js' in resources.
