## Tutorial 3: Read dynamic data from Firestore and bind via Pug

In the previous tutorial, you learnt about static data binding. In this tutorial, we show how you can implement __dynamic data binding__. That is when data is combined with markup runtime, i.e. in the browser. That allows you to display data that comes from JSON files or API calls such as to a Cloud database. We will use Firebase/Firestore; but you can of course use mbake with other Cloud databases as well.

We consider it a good practice to wrap database access in a web component/custom tag. We like to use [Riot](https://riot.js.org/) for this because Riot is declarative and we can use Pug to easily create Riot tags.

Steps:

1. To learn how Riot tags are written and used in Pug, look at the sample project `fire-ro` that you generated with `mbake -r` in [Tutorial 2](/t2/). Inspect `/riotFirst/tags/first-tag.pug`. It looks something like this:

    ```
    first-tag
        p Dynamic Data:
        p { num }

        script.
            doSomething(arg) {
                console.log('arg: ', arg)
                this.update({num: arg})
            }
    ```

    When doSomething() gets called, it updates the {num}.

    You would run `'mbake -t .'` to generate a `first-tag.js` file to include in your page. mbake looks for files that end in `-tag.pug'`.
    
    `/riotFirst/index.pug` uses this tag and looks like this:

    ```
    head
        title #{title}
    body
        //- include Riot
        script(src='//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/riot@3.11.1/riot.min.js')
        //- include the tag script
        script(src='tags/first-tag.min.js')
        p
        div
            //- use the tag
            first-tag
        script.
            var firstTag = riot.mount('first-tag')[0] // get the tag
            firstTag.doSomething(42) // call the logic
    ```
    You can see it working by going to `/riotFirst/` in the browser.


2. Read the [Firebase/Firestore Intro](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)  and the [Firestore Quickstart](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) to get an overview of the Firestore JavaScript API.

3. In the browser, go to `/screens/members/`. Click the 'Get data' button. Data from a live Firestore database should be displayed. As this demo does not use authentication, the database has been configured for read-only access.

4. Inspect `/screens/members/index.pug`:

    ```
    extends /layoutOff/layout

    block head2
        script(src='/screens/members/tags/ro-tag.js')

    block main
        .pad
            ro-tag
            script.
                var myDtag = riot.mount('ro-tag')[0]
    ```
    See how it uses the ro-tag; this is very similar to first-tag in Step 1 above. `ro-tag.js` has been generated with `'mbake -t .'`. As another feature, this index.pug uses `extends` and `block` that pull common page elements from a common layout.pug. 

5. Next inspect `/screens/members/tags/ro-tag.pug`. It looks something like this:

    ```
    ro-tag
        include ro
        hr
        p { dat }
        hr
        .buts
            button#data.btn(type='submit') Get data
        ...
        script.
            // script that loads data on button click
            ...
    ```
    This tag imports the standard database connection script from ro.pug with `include ro`. It also has the `{dat}` placeholder for the dynamic data and the button to get data. Inspect the `script.` section for the code that loads data on button click. It should look very similar to what you've seen in the Firestore Intro.

Summary: With mbake, Pug and a few lines of embedded JavaScript, you can pull data from a live database and dynamically render it in the browser. All without your own Linux or database server. The app  app itself is statically hosted in the cloud. This is what extreme serverless is about. 

If your app needs custom serverside logic that needs access from a browser, you could provide it through a client-side JavaScript API that is modeled or styled like Firestore.

In the next tutorial, you will learn how to create your own Firestore database, add authentication to the app, and insert/update data.
