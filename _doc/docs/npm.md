## How to install mbake with NPM

The simplest way to install mbake is using Yarn. But if you use some additional flags, you can use NPM instead. 
NPM needs the extra flags to be able to install Electron. Electron is used for the watcher (mbake -w). 

From a command line such as PowerShell, type:

```
   npm i -g mbake --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root

```

That's it! If you don't have Node with NPM installed, first go [here for Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [here for MAC](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac).
